# ChefConf2023Slides

This repo contains the slides to a talk I gave at [ChefConf 2023](https://www.chef.io/chefconf/seattle) on how we manage Jenkins entirely via Infrastructure as Code including [JCaSC](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/jcasc/) and [Chef](https://www.chef.io/). 

Questions and comments are welcome in issues, or you can reach out to me if you are looking for help implementing these ideas.
